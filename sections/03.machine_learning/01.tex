\subsection{Multi-label classification using Learning Classifier Systems}

Context: Diploma Thesis, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, Greece.\\

Problem statement: suppose a set of annotated data of multiple labels (not
multiple classes: each instance is simultaneously classified to more than one
labels). Given this set, we would like to build a classifier which, trained with
this set, can classify unseen data to multiple labels with the highest accuracy
possible.

The solution was sought through the framework of Learning Classifier Systems,
systems that represent data instances with rules of the form
``antecedents => consequents". Within this frame, rules undergo (a) crossover
with other rules depending on a measure of their ``quality" (their fitness),
and (b) mutations indiscriminately during crossover, through time, iteratively.
The resulting classifier was compared against the state-of-the-art classifiers
on a number of datasets and its performance was found to be (a) overall the best
in terms of accuracy, and (b) not statistically significantly better than those
it was compared against.\\\\
