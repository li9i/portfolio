\subsection{Play Simon with a Raspberry Pi}

Context: Systems and Control in Practice EL2222 Project, Royal Institute of
Technology (KTH), Stockholm, Sweden.\\

The game ``Simon" is used as a measure of the ability to retain memories, and in
particular, memories of events and their sequence. The simplicity of the game
can be captured by the equal simplicity with which the game as an artefact can
be set up using a Raspberry pi, a small breadboard, four or more leds
and some cables.
