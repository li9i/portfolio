\begin{problem}
Assume a remotely controlled vehicle chassis of Ackermann
steering, equipped with a laser rangefinder and a computing unit. Given a
straight path (something that simulates a road lane, e.g. a corridor), the goal
is for the vehicle to navigate the path while always staying in the middle of it.
\end{problem}

The solution to the problem involves solving two distinct and independent
sub-problems, centered around the (a) translational error, and (b) the
rotational error, with respect to the middle line of the path. Furthermore, the
problem can be approached by two ways: through the design of a PID controller,
which is easier to setup, faster in execution, but potentially difficult to
tune, and through that of a MPC controller, which requires more work, is slower
in execution, but is more robust than the PID controller. Figure
\ref{fig:centerline_pid_error} shows the evolution of the one-dimensional
angular error of the vehicle under control by the PID controller.
