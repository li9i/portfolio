\begin{problem}
In a given 3D physical workspace there are a number of agents whose motion is
described by non-linear continuous-time dynamics, and a number of obstacles.
All agents are constrained in (a) moving within the workspace boundaries and
(b) avoiding collisions with each other and with the obstacles in the
workspace. Additionally, some agents are constrained in keeping certain
distance bounds from other agents. Given this setting and these constraints,
the goal is for the whole multi-agent system to navigate itself from some
initial configuration to a goal configuration and to stay there (be stable
there), regardless of disturbances affecting the agents.
\end{problem}

One solution to this problem is the design of a robust model predictive control
regime for the entire team of cooperating robot systems. In this case there are
two schools of thought: control laws are handed down by an all-knowing supreme
authority, or calculated by each agent individually, with the incomplete
knowledge that each possesses. The decentralised approach is more grounded in
reality than the first approach, assumes an additional degree of independence
between agents, and makes no further requirements of the overall system. While
the problem involves agents whose dynamics are independent of one-another, the
decentralised solution given here couples their constraints as the means of
capturing the cooperative behaviour required.  Figure
\ref{fig:d_OFF_res_trajectory_3_2} shows a three-agent system controlled by
such a control regime, passing through a narrow gap between two objects before
reaching its intended configuration, without additionally violating its
prescribed constraints.

Analytical proofs are given to show that under the proposed control regime: (a)
Subject to initial feasibility, the optimization solved at each step by each
agent will always be feasible, irrespective of whether or not disturbances
affect the agents. (b) Each (sub)system can be stabilized to a desired
configuration, either asymptotically---when uncertainty is absent---or within a
neighbourhood of it when uncertainty is present, thus attenuating the
affecting disturbance. In this context disturbances are assumed to be additive
and bounded.
