\subsection{Robust Decentralized Control of Cooperative Multi-robot Systems}

Context: M.Sc. Degree Project, Royal Institute of Technology (KTH), Stockholm, Sweden.\\

Problem statement: suppose that in a given 3D physical workspace there are
a number of objects, and a number of agents whose control we are after, and
whose motion is described by non-linear continuous time dynamics. All agents
are constrained (a) in being within the workspace boundaries and (b) in avoiding
collisions with each other and with the obstacles in the workspace. Some agents
are constrained in keeping certain distance bounds from other agents. Given this
setting and these constraints, the goal is for the whole multi-agent system to
navigate itself from some initial configuration to a goal configuration and to
stay there (be stable there), regardless of disturbances affecting the agents.
Figure \ref{fig:d_OFF_res_trajectory_3_2} shows a three-agent system passing
through a narrow gap between two objects before reaching its intended
configuration and without violating its specified constraints.

One solution of this problem involves the design of a robust decentralized model
predictive control regime for the team of cooperating robot systems. The problem
involves agents whose dynamics are independent of one-another, and its solution
couples their constraints as a means of capturing the cooperative behaviour required.

In this work, analytical proofs are given to show that, under the proposed
control regime: (a) Subject to initial feasibility, the optimization solved at
each step by each agent will always be feasible, irrespective of whether or not
disturbances affect the agents. (b) Each (sub)system can be stabilized to a
desired configuration, either asymptotically when uncertainty is absent,
or within a neighbourhood of it, when uncertainty is present, thus attenuating
the affecting disturbance. In this context, disturbances are assumed to be
additive and bounded.

Simulations verify the efficacy of the proposed method over a range of
different operating environments.\\
